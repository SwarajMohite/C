After all the bot display whole form with confirmed college...

In short this bot can serve as a virtual admission assistant, 
guiding students through the college selection and application process.

It serves as a valuable resource for educational institutions, helping them attract and enroll 
qualified candidates while enhancing the overall efficiency and transparency of the 
admission process.
